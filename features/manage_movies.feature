Feature: manage movie list

  As a movie administrator
  So that I can manage movies
  I want to add/delete movies from the list

Background: movies in database

  Given the following movies exist:
  | title        | rating | director     | release_date |
  | Star Wars    | PG     | George Lucas |   1977-05-25 |
  | Blade Runner | PG     | Ridley Scott |   1982-06-25 |

  | THX-1138     | R      | George Lucas |   1971-03-11 |

Scenario: add movie
  Given I am on the home page
  When I follow "Add new movie"
  Then I should be on the Create New Movie page
  When I fill in "Title" with "Men In Black"
  And I select "PG-13" from "Rating"
  And I press "Save Changes"
  Then I should be on the home page
  And I should see "Men In Black"
